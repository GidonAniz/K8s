Pod Design Questions: • Understand how to use Labels, Selectors and Annotations • Understand Deployments and how to perform rolling updates • Understand Deployments and how to perform rollbacks • Understand Jobs and CronJobs 
1. Type the command for:  Get pods with label information 
2. Create 5 nginx pods in which two of them is labeled env=prod and three of them is labeled env=dev 
3. Verify all the pods are created with correct labels 
4. Get the pods with label env=dev 
5. Get the pods with label env=dev and also output the labels 
6. Get the pods with label env=prod 
7. Get the pods with label env=prod and also output the labels 
8. Get the pods with label env 
9. Get the pods with labels env=dev and env=prod 
10. Get the pods with labels env=dev and env=prod and output the labels as well 
11. Change the label for one of the pod to env=uat and list all the pods to verify 
12. Remove the labels for the pods that we created now and verify all the labels are removed 
13. Let’s add the label app=nginx for all the pods and verify (using kubectl) 
14. Get all the nodes with labels (if using minikube you would get only master node) 
15. Label the worker node nodeName=nginxnode 
16. Create a Pod that will be deployed on the worker node with the label nodeName=nginxnode  
  Add the nodeSelector to the below and create the pod:
  apiVersion: v1 
  kind: Pod 
  metadata:   
    creationTimestamp: null   
    labels:    
      run: nginx  
    name: nginx 
  spec:   
    containers:   
    - image: nginx    
      name: nginx    
      resources: {}   
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst   
    restartPolicy: 
  Never status: {} 

17. Verify the pod that it is scheduled with the node selector on the right node... fix it if it’s not behind scheduled. 
18. Verify the pod nginx that we just created has this label
